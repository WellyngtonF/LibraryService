# LibraryService

Just a simple project to track my reading progress and my books.

## API

Service is a API with CRUD operations for books and authors.

### Technologies

- .NET 8
- PostgreSQL
- Entity Framework Core
- Docker

## Unit Tests

I build two projects for unit tests:

- `unitTests_NUnit`: Unit tests made with NUnit.
- `unitTests_XUnit`: Unit tests made with XUnit.

The reason for this is to compare the two most popular unit test frameworks code and demonstrate my skills with both.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests are made with SpecFlow.

## Objectives

Demonstrate my skills with .NET 8, Entity Framework Core and Docker.

The branch `dapper` is a version of the project using Dapper instead of EF Core.
